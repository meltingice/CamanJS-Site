  <p><b>Javascript (Ca)vas (Man)ipulation</b></p>
  
  <p>The main focus of CamanJS is manipulating images using the HTML5 canvas and Javascript. It's a combination of a simple-to-use interface with advanced and efficient image/canvas editing techniques. It is also completely library independent and can be safely used next to jQuery, YUI, Scriptaculous, MooTools, etc.</p>

  <p>CamanJS is very easy to extend with new filters and plugins, and it comes with a wide array of image editing functionality, which is only growing as the community makes more plugins. It has a powerful layering system, much like the one present in Photoshop and GIMP, that makes the sky the limit for your creativity.</p>
